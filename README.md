## REDOUBLER

REDOUBLER is an Random Number Generator based on Modular Entropy Multiplication. The device plugs
into a hosts's USB port, and ennumerates as a standard microphone. When the microphone is sampled it produces
white noise which contains a high proportion of random entropy. The digital data behind that white noise
is random numbers, and they can be recorded and used for any purpose that requires non-deterministic randomness.

By ennumerating as a standard USB microphone (sound card with one input) REDOUBLER does not require drivers
on any major operating system. This simplifies developments, and reduces the "attack surfacce" that an
adversary can use to compromise security.
