# OS-X Host Software

No information yet. The Cypress firmware used as a starting point is 
known to work on Mac. Mac has **/dev/random** and **/dev/urandom** device like Linux, but they implement Yarrow in the kernel, and have no distinction between them. Please contribute any information you have.

If someone wants to create the software to recognise a REDOUBLER on Mac as send its entropy to the OS, I'll be happy to provide a REDOUBLER.
