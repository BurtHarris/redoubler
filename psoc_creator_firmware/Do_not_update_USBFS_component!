When the workspace or project is first opened in PSoC Creator, it will offer to update all components
to their latest available versions. Do not upgrade the USBFS component -- it causes compile errors and
endless repeated attempts to enumerate the REDOUBLER when it is plugged into a computer. Choose "Cancel"
instead.

I am working with Cypress to find a solution for this.
